# Project Context & Strategy

## The Problem: "The Instagram Trap"
**Observation**: The Sales Manager currently spends **60% of her working and personal time** prospecting on Instagram (reading posts, looking for new leads). 
**Hidden Asset**: The company already possesses a database of **13,000+ contacts** (clients, suppliers, leads) that is currently underutilized because it's locked in legacy formats (VCard/Excel) and hard to search.

**The Pivot**: Instead of trying to automate the Instagram prospecting (which is technically risky and complex), the highest value move is to **unlock the existing 13k contacts**. 

## The Solution: "Contact Mining & High-Velocity Quotes"

### 1. Contact Mining (The "Gold Mine")
**Goal**: Shift the 60% time from *searching strangers* to *selling to acquaintances*.
**Mechanism**:
- A powerful **Search & Filter** interface.
- Ability to segment contacts by location, type, or past interactions.
- "Rediscovering" lost leads within the own database is 5x more efficient than colder outreach.

### 2. High-Velocity Quotations (The "Closer")
**Goal**: Minimize the friction between "Interest" and "Offer".
**Mechanism**:
- **Quotes Module**: Create professional PDF/Text quotes in seconds, not minutes.
- **Problem Solved**: High lead volume is useless if the closure process (making a quote) is valid manual and slow. 
- **Tech**: 
  - `quotes` table for tracking.
  - `products` catalog integration (no more manual price lookups).
  - WhatsApp-ready output.

## Strategic Priority
**Priority 1**: **Contact Mining Interface** (To enable the shift from Instagram).
**Priority 2**: **Quotations Module** (To monetize the interactions efficiently).
